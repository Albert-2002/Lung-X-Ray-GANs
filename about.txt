**Problem Statements:**

1. Given a set of clean chest X-ray images, insert extraneous objects in a realistic way.
2. Given a set of chest X-ray images with extraneous objects, eliminate foreground objects that obscure the human anatomy.

**Expected Outcome**

A Deep Learning model trained for an image editing(insertion/elimination) task, along with the inference scripts.
Extra points if the same model can cater to both tasks.

**Extra:**

Data preparation for Deep Learning Models in such a situation can proceed in two ways - On the training data,
detect the presence of such extraneous objects in individual images and airbrush them,
to create a more homogenous cohort of data. Alternatively, insert extraneous objects into ‘pristine’ images to enrich the data variety of the cohort.
In the first instance, Deep Learning model can safely infer on the presented X-ray image and in the second instance,
the increased availability of external objects will help the model factor in the noise during inference.
